## GitHub Pages (auto-published)
This repo publishes charts to **GitHub Pages** after CI finishes.

- After you push a CSV into `data/` and CI runs, visit:  
  `https://<YOUR-USER>.github.io/amazon-keyword-insights/`

> Replace `<YOUR-USER>` above with your GitHub username. You can change the repo name too; the workflows will still work.
